# Text_Classification_with_Tensorflow_Hub
Here I have used the IMDB dataset which consists of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. With the help of tensorflow_hub, a library for loading trained models from 
TFHub in a single line of code, I have done the classification.
I have refered tensorflow training for this project.
